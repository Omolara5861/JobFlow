## Introduction
Job Flow is a web-based application that allows users to manage their job applications. The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to create, view, and update job listings. Users can add important details such as the job title, company name, and application deadline. The application also includes features for scheduling interviews and tracking the status of each application.

Job Flow is built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack, which makes it a robust and scalable application. The frontend is designed with React, which provides a responsive and fast user interface. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, which makes it easy to develop and maintain a scalable server-side application. MongoDB is used for data storage, which provides flexibility and scalability for handling large amounts of data.

Job Flow also includes a comprehensive [API documentation](), using Swagger. This allows users to easily understand how the application works and how to interact with it programmatically. With Job Flow, users can easily manage their job applications and streamline their job search process.
